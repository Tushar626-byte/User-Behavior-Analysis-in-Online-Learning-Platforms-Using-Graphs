# User Behavior Analysis in Online Learning Platforms Using Graphs 📊

This repository examines user behavior in online learning platforms through graph data structures. By modeling user interactions as graphs, it reveals key insights into engagement patterns, course progression, and community dynamics.

## Key Features 🚀

- **User Interaction Network**: Maps user-content interactions to understand engagement trends.
- **Graph Metrics Calculation**: Computes essential metrics, including centrality, clustering, and connectivity.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Provides insights into potential drop-off rates and active learning patterns based on graph data.
